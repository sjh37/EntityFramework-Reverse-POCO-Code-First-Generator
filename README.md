## EntityFramework Reverse POCO Code First Generator

Reverse engineers an existing database and generates Entity Framework Code
First Poco classes, Configuration mappings and DbContext.

**Beautifully generated code first code that is fully customisable**

* Downloadable VSIX installer from the [visual studio gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SimonHughes.EntityFrameworkReversePOCOGenerator).
* Watch the v2 in-depth course at [pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/code-first-entity-framework-legacy-databases/table-of-contents) ![logo](http://www.simonhughes.co.uk/pluralsight-logo-tiny.png) I cover everything the v2 generator can do, and show you step-by-step how to reverse engineer your database properly.

Please note, this is not the Microsoft reverse generator.
This generator creates code as if you reverse engineered a database and lovingly created the code by hand. 
It also allows you to customise the generated code to your liking.

### Upgrading v2 to v3
Please read the [Upgrading documentation](https://github.com/sjh37/EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Code-First-Generator/wiki/Upgrading-from-v2-to-v3)

### What's new

[Click here](https://github.com/sjh37/EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Code-First-Generator/releases) to see what's new in this release.

### Supported databases

* SQL Server
* SQL Server Compact 3.5 and 4.0
* PostgreSQL
* Coming soon: Oracle, MySQL

### Highly customisable output

This generator was designed to be customisable from the very beginning,
and not fixed and rigid like other generators.
Go and play with the settings in the `<database>.tt` file, that's what it's there for.

If your database changes, simply re-save the `<database>.tt` file. That's it.

### To install and use this project:
* Use Nuget and install the relevant nuget package for your database.
  - .Net Core: `install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
  - EF 6: `install-package EntityFramework`
* `Settings.ConnectionString` is mandatory in v3, so you need to provide the connection string from your app.config/web.config/appsettings.json file. This connection string is used by the generator to reverse engineer your database. It no longer reads your connection strings from *.config files.

   For example:

   Settings.ConnectionString = "Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=false;TrustServerCertificate=true";
* The `Settings.ConnectionString` string you use must have at least these privileges: `ddladmin`, `datareader` and `datawriter`. `ddladmin` is required for reading the default constraints.
* In Visual Studio, right click project and select "add - new item".
* Select Online, and search for **reverse poco**.
* Select **EntityFramework Reverse POCO Generator**.
* Give the file a name, such as `Database.tt` and click Add.
* Edit the `Database.tt` file and specify the full connection string in `Settings.ConnectionString`. This is used by the generater to read your database schema and reverse engineer it.
* Edit the `Database.tt` file and specify the connection string in `Settings.ConnectionStringName` which matches the ConnectionString key as specified in your `appsettings.json`, `app.config` or `web.config`.
* Save the `Database.tt` file, which will now generate the `Database.cs` file. Every time you save your `Database.tt` file, the generator will run and reverse engineer your database.
* There are many options you can use to customise the generated code. All of these settings are in the `Database.tt` files.

### Connection strings and how they are used
`Settings.ConnectionString` is mandatory in version 3. It is used by the generator to read your database schema. It's also placed into the generated code:

```c#
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder){{#newline}}
{{{#newline}}
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured){{#newline}}
    {{{#newline}}
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@""{{ConnectionString}}"");{{#newline}}
    }{{#newline}}
}{{#newline}}{{#newline}}
```

`Settings.ConnectionStringName` Not used by the generator, but is placed into the generated DbContext constructor via a call to `Settings.DefaultConstructorArgument`.

```c#
public {{DbContextName}}(){{#newline}}
{{#if HasDefaultConstructorArgument}}
    : base({{DefaultConstructorArgument}}){{#newline}}
{{/if}}
```

### UI

A simple UI for the generator is available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/sjh37/EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Generator-UI) which helps you to create a regex to filter your tables.

### Editing TT (T4) Files
To have full syntax highlighting and intellisense when editing TT files, I use the Resharper plugin ForTea. I can't imagine editing TT files without it.

With the new v3, you no longer have to edit the `EF.Reverse.POCO.v3.ttinclude` file as this file is now generated from a C# project. This repository includes the BuildTT file which creates the `EF.Reverse.POCO.v3.ttinclude` from the `Generator` C# project.

### Getting a pull request accepted
Have a read of [https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request](How to write the perfect pull request)

My requirements are simple:

1. Always keep the changes to a **minimum**, so I can see **exactly** what's changed in regard to the pull request. I.e. No whitespace tidy up, etc.
2. No tabs, only spaces (4).
3. Edit the Generator C# project, as this is what is used to create the `EF.Reverse.POCO.v3.ttinclude` file. This repository includes the `BuildTT` project which creates the `EF.Reverse.POCO.v3.ttinclude` from the `Generator` C# project.
4. Don't be tempted to do a few different enhancements in one pull request. Have **one** pull request for **one** bug fix / enhancement.

Simon Hughes
